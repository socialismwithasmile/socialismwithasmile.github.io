            Later on, I will present a theory of Principle and Practice such that
             Marxist principles are those that hold over and above changing material
              conditions and practice is the theory and tactics produced by applying
              those principles to the material conditions that exist in each time and place.
              </p>
              <p class="text-left">
              It is important to note how I have arrived at a specific set of
              Marxist principles. I will not claim like Adorno or Althusser
              that I have achieved some incredible “new reading” of Marx and
              Lenin that draws out a previously hidden authorial intent. In
              fact, most of the principles I repeat are hardly new and hardly
              my ideas, they are mostly drawn from an understanding of Marx
              that is already prominent in the Leninist and Trotskyist
              tradition. I hold, as did Marx, that “The philosophers have only
              interpreted the world, in various ways; the point is to change
              it.” And so, the starting point of any philosopher (so anyone
              really) should be “How do I want to change the world; what
              possible future do I counterpose to our present?”. I choose this
              particular theorization of Marxism, not because it is the one
              “true” Marxism based on authorial intent, nor because it is the
              one “true” Marxism in terms of predictive scientific capacity of
              the world around it, but because it is the Marxism that I believe
              is the most useful for the movement at large to achieve communism.
              </p>
              <p class="text-left">
              This answers both the general question: why Marxism? And the specific
               question: Why this Marxism? But it doesn’t answer the question:
               Why do you accept the goal of a communist society as your starting
                point? In fact, openly stating that I do is tantamount to embracing
                 the kind of “authoritarian realism” that Vattimo castigates Marxism
                  for. How can you claim that philosophers themselves are products
                   of their time and place, and yet yourself claim to posit an
                   ultimate goal of human society? If everything is marked and
                   produced in the society it is born in, then how can you
                   possibly imagine or even build a world not tainted by these
                   same problems? It is quite clear that it is impossible to
                   stand outside society and yet, standing within our society
                   we can posit a different one, such is the power of Marxism.
                   As Marx once said:

                 <blockquote class="blockquote">
                   <p class="mb-0">Whereas the still immature communism seeks an
                  <i>historical</i> proof for itself – a proof in the realm of what
                  already exists – among disconnected historical phenomena
                  opposed to private property, tearing single phases from the
                  historical process and focusing attention on them as proofs
                  of its historical pedigree ... By so doing it simply makes
                  clear that by far the greater part of this process contradicts
                  its own claim, and that, if it has ever existed, precisely
                  its being in the <i>past</i> refutes its pretension to <i>reality.</i>
                  It is easy to see that the entire revolutionary movement
                  necessarily finds both its empirical and its theoretical
                  basis in the movement of <i>private property</i> – more precisely,
                  in that of the economy.

              <p class="text-left">
              I hold that this is still true now as then. I did not discover
              the ideal society that I wanted by looking to the past and
              extrapolating into the future. I did it by observing the
              problems with the present and postulating that a society could
              exist that isn’t everything our society is. All knowledge comes
              from the society that we live in. All philosophy is born out of
              its time. And yet great philosophy imagines a future that
              outstrips ours, it does this by negating all that holds us back
              in our current time. Because all we know is alienation under
              extraction of surplus value, at home & at work we posit a future
              without the extraction of surplus value. Because all we know is
              contradictions in society such as racism and heteropatriarchy we
              posit a society where these contradictions are resolved. Most
              importantly, because all we know is alienation under class
              society we posit a classless future. While we are stuck in our
              present and thus incapable of truly imagining this future, so
              tainted are we by our present, we can still achieve it by
              embracing a Marxist analysis best suited to the task of this
              radical transformation of society.

            <h3 class="text-center">The Distinction Between Principle & Practice</h3>
            <p "text-left">
              It is important to as a Marxist understand the dichotomy between
               principle and practice. i.e. between the shared ideas and
               conceptualizations that make up the bedrock of effective Marxism
               and how those principles should be applied to a particular
               material condition. The entire system of Principles and Practice
               is a system of dialectic production. Contradictions within our
               existing class society produce the impetus for Marxist
               Principles. Principles, as a whole represent on the most basic
               level an analysis of society and history as based on material
               forces from which is drawn the idea of class struggle and an
               ultimate goal: International Communism from which is drawn the
               means of Proletarian Revolution and Working-Class Party
               Organization. These ideas are themselves both means
               (revolution, party organization) and ends
               (revolution, communism) but none-the-less they themselves are
               still principles. Then, these principles themselves can be
               reapplied to contradictions within society in order to produce
               Practice which are both tactical and theoretical conceptions to
               be used by specific movements. For example, there is no Marxist
               Principle of how to respond to a particular setback or
               provocation. Instead Marxist Principles themselves provide a
               means from which the workers movement itself decides on practice.
            </p>
            <p class="text-left">
              However, none of this is to say that Marx discovered the “truth”
              of class struggle and the path to communism and that the task of
              modern Marxists and working-class revolutionaries is merely to
              apply the ideas of Karl Marx in such a way that our shared end of
               communism will be achieved. In the Manifesto Marx himself puts
               this nonsense to rest saying
            </p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p class="mb-0">
                  The theoretical conclusions of the Communists are in no way
                  based on ideas or principles that have been invented, or
                  discovered, by this or that would-be universal reformer.
                  They merely express, in general terms, actual relations
                  springing from an existing class struggle, from a historical
                  movement going on under our very eyes. The abolition of
                  existing property relations is not at all a distinctive
                  feature of communism.
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class = "text-left">
              In other words, principles themselves are also subject to
              critique and debate.
            </p>
            <p class="text-left">
              Thus, the truth of the distinction really lies in the idea that
              principles are either definitional or analysis of unchanging or
              systemic aspects of capitalism not of its objective conditions.
              Karl Marx himself has contributed much of the basis of our
              Principles but these principles might be apparent to any
              working-class person to whom the contradictions of capitalism
              themselves are nakedly obvious. It is useful to lean on Marx,
              Engels and others for understanding of communist principles
              because they put so much work into organizing and rigorously
              conventionalizing them, but the revolutionary communist movement
              is greater than Marx and his theory making Marxism itself,
              confusingly enough, greater than the works of Karl Marx.
