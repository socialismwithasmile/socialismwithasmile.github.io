            Later on, I will present a theory of Principle and Practice such that
             Marxist principles are those that hold over and above changing material
              conditions and practice is the theory and tactics produced by applying
              those principles to the material conditions that exist in each time and place.

              It is important to note how I have arrived at a specific set of
              Marxist principles. I will not claim like Adorno or Althusser
              that I have achieved some incredible “new reading” of Marx and
              Lenin that draws out a previously hidden authorial intent. In
              fact, most of the principles I repeat are hardly new and hardly
              my ideas, they are mostly drawn from an understanding of Marx
              that is already prominent in the Leninist and Trotskyist
              tradition. I hold, as did Marx, that “The philosophers have only
              interpreted the world, in various ways; the point is to change
              it.” And so, the starting point of any philosopher (so anyone
              really) should be “How do I want to change the world; what
              possible future do I counterpose to our present?”. I choose this
              particular theorization of Marxism, not because it is the one
              “true” Marxism based on authorial intent, nor because it is the
              one “true” Marxism in terms of predictive scientific capacity of
              the world around it, but because it is the Marxism that I believe
              is the most useful for the movement at large to achieve communism.

              This answers both the general question: why Marxism? And the specific
               question: Why this Marxism? But it doesn’t answer the question:
               Why do you accept the goal of a communist society as your starting
                point? In fact, openly stating that I do is tantamount to embracing
                 the kind of “authoritarian realism” that Vattimo castigates Marxism
                  for. How can you claim that philosophers themselves are products
                   of their time and place, and yet yourself claim to posit an
                   ultimate goal of human society? If everything is marked and
                   produced in the society it is born in, then how can you
                   possibly imagine or even build a world not tainted by these
                   same problems? It is quite clear that it is impossible to
                   stand outside society and yet, standing within our society
                   we can posit a different one, such is the power of Marxism.
                   As Marx once said:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p class="mb-0">Whereas the still immature communism seeks an
                  <i>historical</i> proof for itself – a proof in the realm of what
                  already exists – among disconnected historical phenomena
                  opposed to private property, tearing single phases from the
                  historical process and focusing attention on them as proofs
                  of its historical pedigree ... By so doing it simply makes
                  clear that by far the greater part of this process contradicts
                  its own claim, and that, if it has ever existed, precisely
                  its being in the <i>past</i> refutes its pretension to <i>reality.</i>
                  It is easy to see that the entire revolutionary movement
                  necessarily finds both its empirical and its theoretical
                  basis in the movement of <i>private property</i> – more precisely,
                  in that of the economy.
